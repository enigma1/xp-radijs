# Experimenting with radi.js

[radi-js](https://radi.js.org)

My objective for this repository is to test and evaluate RadiJS, therefore I had to setup a basic server side environment and convert some of the older radijs samples because not many examples were working with the latest core changes.

- Setup environment, Babel, Webpack
- Setup server side rendering
- Use listener, render, mount to take advantage of hyperscript
- Use the counter sample to test functionality 

#### To install/run
```sh
$ npm i
$ npm run webpack
$ npm start
```
I utilized the counter example controlling the +/- state of a simple counter and using the listeners to enable/disable controls. See src/index.js
